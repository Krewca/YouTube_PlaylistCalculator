If you open a playlist on YouTube and want to count his views, YT shows only "Number of playlist views", not summary of the videos.


This app runs through all the videos and presents you with their views and summary.


Usage:

python3 YT_PlaylistCalc.py (no arguments) - App asks for playlist ID and then throws only view summary

-l / --list - Lists all videos in playlist with their corresponding views

-v / --viewsOnlyList - Lists only views of videos without their names (for statistical purposes)

-p <ID> / --playlistId <ID> - Pass the playlist ID directly into program argument
